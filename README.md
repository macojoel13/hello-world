# hello-world
My first repository, just learning how to create them.
  
  Hello GitHub community, my name is Marco Le√≥n, 
  right now I'm studying a Bachelor Degree on Video Game Design (Programming)
  in Atlantic University in Guaynabo, Puerto Rico. I saw GitHub as a good opportunity
  to improve my skills in programming, so I joined the website.
  Right now I'm working on my problem solving skills, and mostly focusing on the C++ language, 
  although in the future I wish to expand my experiences and try a lot more programming
  languages.
